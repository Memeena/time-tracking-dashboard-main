## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Worked on improving my skills by practising flex and grid layouts extensively through out the project. Tried both flex and grid for every component and picked which suited best for the particular component.

### Continued development

As of now I am learning React. Once I feel confident, shall recreate the project using React Framework.
